    "description": "The architect behind the Palace of Alcazarzaray, Kaveh was a student of the Kshahrewar Darshan of the Sumeru Akademiya and graduated with honors, earning the moniker 'Light of Kshahrewar.' Having become insolvent after the construction of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, he was forced to reside with Alhaitham, whom he has a complicated relationship with. In spite of the illustrious fa√ßade he maintains to outsiders, Kaveh is often saddled with guilt for his father's death, ashamed of his poverty, and struggling with realizing his ideals.",

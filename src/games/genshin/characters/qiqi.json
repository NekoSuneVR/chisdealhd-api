    "description": "An apprentice and herb gatherer at Bubu Pharmacy. \"Blessed\" by the adepti with a body that cannot die, this petite zombie cannot do anything without first giving herself orders to do it. Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook in which she writes anything important that she is sure to forget later.",

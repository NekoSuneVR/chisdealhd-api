    "description": "A long time ago, in a land far far away, there was a small VRChat player named JackSederwall (later known as HikarVR). He had been hanging out in a place called [The Black Cat](https://vrchat-legends.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Cat). He had been talking about how he wanted to show off his cute face to the world of [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hikarivr). Eventually he did set sail on this road to streaming.",

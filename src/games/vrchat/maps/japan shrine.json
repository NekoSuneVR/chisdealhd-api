    "description": "The Japan Shrine was a very popular and beautiful map in VRChat where people from all different cultures gathered in 2018. In 2019 the map was suddenly made private by the author and replaced with an empty map. There are other new Japan shrine maps but this one remains gone. The reason why the author chose to remove the map is unknown.",
